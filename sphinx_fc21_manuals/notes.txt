    effects.rst -- ? how are we going to document effects ? -- my general thought is to include on the page
        where the effect applies
    styles.rst -- ? how do we want to document the styles ? -- generally not very important information here

TODO:
- Figure out best way to document the nations. They are duplicated across the rulesets in some cases and some rulesets have their own set.
- Figure out best way to document terrain. I'll bet there is a lot of overlap between the rulesets. Will need terrain specific sprites if we want to show it on the page.
- Gather effects and document them where they are "effected" and not as a big page of them
- Need a detailed look at the helptext across all rulesets. Many items need to be cleaned up to be rst friendly. Usage of consonants and other doco style are not being followed.
- Create a universal look up page to document what the requirement vector table columns mean. Link to it where needed.
- The current graphics for the techs are really crappy. Before we go and show a graphic for the tech advances, need to get that issue fixed first.
- Roll some kind of loop that looks for a set of words to recast using interpretive text roles. e.g. all the units, buildings, wonders and advances have
  custom roles that should be enabled in the generated rst.


FIXES:
- SPRITE: The wonder mausoleum_of_halicarnassus sprite is referred to as simply mausoleum in most rulesets, causing an issue with image lookup
- BLDG: Fix building flags (see airport in royale, or others that say "set()" or city walls with "{‘VisibleByOthers’}")
- UNIT: The unit obsoletes value isn't working. for example, cavalry obsoletes knights in a lot of rulesets. Another example is pikemen obsolete phalanx.
- UNIT: Some rulesets have the mobility bonus added to the name of the veteran level causing duplicated information in the table
- IMAGES: Need to find a way to see if an image sprite exists on the filesystem and if not, don't write out the image code in the template. Good use of a global function to process in the template page.


QUESTIONS:
- Do we have any rulesets that use the "convert" feature for units? Would be good to see if the code works there.
